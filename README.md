## ABSTRACT
The expansion of e-commerce and digital marketing in recent years has resulted in a massive amount of personal data. E-commerce online applications are nearly widespread in our daily lives, yet as beneficial as they are, most of them have little to no adjustment to user needs, which can result in both reduced conversion rates and dissatisfied customers. We propose a machine learning system that learns from prior sessions and forecasts useful metrics. As the volume of data grows, it becomes more difficult for businesses to handle it, thus innovative approaches are developed. This research aims at understanding the relationship between various variables through machine learning algorithms and exploring insights of customer reviews of e-commerce products, as well as to classify the product and provide business solutions.

This project contains Tableau worked sheets where most of the visualaization part is experimented. A copy of pdf is also available.
